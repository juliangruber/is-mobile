# is-mobile

Check if mobile browser, based on useragent string.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/is-mobile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/is-mobile)

## Example

```js
var mobile = require('is-mobile');

console.log(mobile());
// => false
```

## API

### mobile([user-agent], [options])

Returns true if a mobile browser is being used. If you don't specify
`user-agent` it will use `navigator.userAgent`. To detect tablets, pass `{ tablets: true }` as `options` argument.

### mobile(request, [options])

Returns true if the given [node.js http request](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage) comes with a mobile user agent header.

Example:

```js
var http = require('http');
var mobile = require('is-mobile');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.end(mobile(req));
});

server.listen(8000);
```

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install is-mobile
```

Bundle for the browser with
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).
